# Hub16

A macro pad with 16 keys, two rotary encoders, a four port USB hub, and plenty of LEDs!

This project started as I wanted to utilise rotary encoders to change the grid and trace size in KiCad, and then thought wouldn't it be cool to run a cable between the macro pad and keyboard, so a hub was added! 

It is designed to work with software on the host computer to enable powerful, context aware macros to be run, ensuring you never have to press a strange sequence of keys ever again. 

All design files required to manufacture the board and enclosure are available, along with a small production run currently in the works to make it easier and cheaper to get your hands on a board. Stay tuned... 

## Key Features
* 16 Cherry MX compatible switches, along with two switches in the encoders. 
* Two rotary encoders, bringing an intuitive interface for many controls such as volume and music playback.
* Four port USB 2.0 hub with Type-C connectors, allowing connection to other keyboards, memory sticks, wireless receivers and more! 
* Designed to interface with host computer to provide a level of interaction / macro control not available on standard keyboards, with examples provided for Windows and Linux. 
* Various case designs, allowing the Hub16 to fit in on any desk. 
* 11 individually addressable RGB LEDs for the bling factor. 
* Full QMK programmability and customisation.
